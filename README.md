The Forgotten Tibia
===============

The Forgotten Tibia is a free and open-source MMORPG game written in C++ and LUA.  
It is a fork from the [The Forgotten Server 1.3](https://github.com/otland/forgottenserver/commit/3b63f65) and [OTClient](https://github.com/edubart/otclient/commit/07b4b78) projects.

## What makes it different from Tibia / The Forgotten Server 1.3?

- ### There are no vocations  
Everyone starts as a normal human being with points to be distributed among the skills.

- ### There is no skill training  
It uses a system to advance skills by distributing points that you receive each level you advance.

- ### All clubs, swords and axes damage are based on strenght.

- ### You can use two one-handed weapons at the same time  
Attack speed will increase and each weapon damage will decrease.

- ### Distance weapons damage are based on strenght and/or dexterity.

- ### Two-handed melee weapons can do critical hit and bleeding effect.

- ### The more levels you get, less points you receive.

- ### You don't need to open monster to pickup loots while hunting  
Just need to select the item you want to loot.

- ### You don't need to refill ammunition when hunting with arrows or bolts  
Just need to use a quiver/container on the arrow slot.

- ### Wands and Rods maximum damage are increased with intelligence and faith.
